# myProgrammingAssignment2
Holds my code for Course 2 Week3 Assignment
1. I forked a repository from instructor's repository: ProgrammingAssignment2
2. I cannot connect my local repository to my GitHub repository ProgrammingAssignment. 
3. I create a new repository to connect to my local repository.
4. I have one R programming file in the local repository: cachematrix.R with two function. 
First function makeCacheMatrix() to get a inversiable matrix and calculate its inverse matrix. 
In the first function, I also assign the inverse matrix into a globale varialbe so that we can 
retrive it without calculate it again when we need it. 
Second function cacheSolve() try to retrive the inverse matrix that i storeed in the global variable.
